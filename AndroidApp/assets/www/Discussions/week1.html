				<p><b>1.Less obvious perks of using 'live' data resources include logins and payments. How could Twitter be used in these two scenarios?</b></p>
				<p>Twitter could be used in both scenarios for the sole purpose of connecting users through certain apps that offer a multiplayer option to where you login with your twitter account and invite your friends to download the app and play also along. For payments twitter could be used to pull account info for the user such as an auto complete on a fom validation.</p> 
				<p><b>2. Visit Programmableweb.com and search for JSON-P data sources. Why would we need JSON-P, specifically?</b></p>
				<p>We use JSON-P because it provides a method to request data from a server in a different domain that is majority of the time restricted by security scripts but JSON-P will allow us to access these various API's and implement them inside our apps.</p>
				<p><b>3.Based on the JSON-P search results: what data resource(s) do you think might pair well with which types of Native device features?</b></p>
				<p>I would say the EventBrite API for my application with the geolocation native device feature so that the user will be able to possibly aquire a location and send there location out to others via twitter or for directions to an event.</p>
				<p><b>4.Please describe any design and functionality intentions you may have for your Demo app components this month.</b></p>
 				<p>I definitely want to inject twitter in my app for the sole purpose i mentioned in the response to the last question so that my users will be able to have easy access to twitter feeds and share what is going on at the event they may be attending.</p>
 				<p><b>5.Briefly describe some past 'lessons learned' regarding workflow as it relates to research, design, development, etc.</b></p>
				<p>Some lessons learned for research, design, and development for me was to be able to start early. The earlier the start the more time you give yourself to meet a deadline. Procastination is your worst enemy. I learned this lesson early on but caught on pretty quick due to the quick pace this degree moves but definitely make sure to get a good jump on assignments and also projects and finish how you start. Time management is very important for a quick paced workflow in my opinion.</p>
