			<p><b>What are the 'top selling' app categories in the U.S.? Japan? Great Britain?</b></p>
<p>
 
The top selling app categories in the U.S. are Games (Angry Birds, Doodle Jump, Fruit Ninja), followed by utility apps such as Camera and Weather.
 
Top selling app categories in Japan are Games (Gang Street Wars by DigiDock (iTunes links: $1.99 for a limited time / free version), Next category is Productivity apps (Zeptoliner by Ubiquitous Entertainment ($6.99 / free version), Then Tools apps( TapNext by Conit ($3.99 / free version))
 
Top selling app categories in UK are Utility apps and Games. Similar to the United States.
</p>


<p><b>Based on your three answers above, what might you infer about each of the markets listed?</b></p>
<p>

Based on the information posted above I would infer that games are the common ground between the different locations. The market for games is vast and majority and people don’t mind paying a few dollars for a quality "Fun" game. Games seem to be accumulating more profit especially with angry birds owner being in talks with investors for a whopping $1.2 billion.
</p>


<p><b>What is the average cost and bandwidth limits per user (in general) in each of the three markets? How may this impact development?</b></p>

<p>
 Japan - 60mbps and they pay $0.27 per 1mbps
 U.S  - 4.8mbps and pay $3.33 per 1mbps
 U.K. - 2.8mbps and average out about $5-10.00 per 1mbps
 

</p>
<p><b>How may this impact development?</b></p>
<p>			
 
For us as developers we will have to limit the massive functionality that our apps are capable of. The code that we use to produce all these awesome features within games and utility apps will have to be left out. I feel that this in turn will cause the download rates to drop a bit because the functionality of these apps and the convenience that and that is what we develop for and limiting bandwidth will cause the apps to lack and lacking apps don’t get downloads. On the other hand users love apps for what they do regardless of data. If a user loves playing angry birds they will continue to play it just in moderation. Although bandwidth limiting will cause developers to not develop apps with such accuracy and some features may have to be left out such as gps which requires a lot of data just to name one data-eating feature.
 </p>
 
 <p><b>what would be your suggested strategy in project topic and global market choice? Feel free to have a first and second choice.</b></p>
<p>			
 
My strategy would be to develop an app first that can be played in both areas Home (here in US) and abroad. First and foremost I would aim at developing games within the US and japan regions due to the fact they produce the most profit. As for the UK utility apps are the most downloaded so I would go with a GPS app or a parking guide app to pinpoint that location and profit as well. If I were to develop an app right now to put on the market and acquire a nice profit would definitely be a Game within the US region. Once successful here I would then look at the type of games inside japan and try to develop a game that gets massive downloads due to the similarity in the market between the two regions. And then follow up with what’s popular in the UK with a Utility app.
