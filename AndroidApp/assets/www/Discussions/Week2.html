			<p><b>What are some of the ways that you could change your HTML on your Demo app to be more accessible?</b></p>
<p>
 
First changes I would make to my HTML to make it more accessible would be to not rely on aesthetics so much and provide more content structure. Some users such as the elderly users may have older devices, which cannot handle a lot of the content color and may be hard for people with color deficits to navigate through the app because of the contrast of the colors. Another way to make the app more accessible would be to instead of using images as navigation tools just use simple text at a larger scale for the visually impaired.

<p><b>Visit a video service on the web (like YouTube) and search for "Screen Reader Demo" and "Mobile Screen Reader" - what are some of the common frustrations (or common support mechanisms) that you see among the examples that are given - how could you fix them (or use them)?</b></p>
<p>

The first common error that I noticed with the Screen readers is that there isn’t a notification to let the user know the exact content that is being read or what section the user is selecting to be read. Also if the user is not a using a mouse but using keyboard only on for example Wal-Mart’s website there is no way that the user can populate one window drilldowns or accordion style drill downs. Also the way the reader is reading the page is not clear and sounds as if it misses the breaks inside the html at times. So to remedy these I would implement notifications that pop up upon hover with a mouse or by using tabs for keyboard only users. The only issue I noticed on mobile phones with accessibility is that it mispronounces words such as "baseband" for example. To remedy this what I would do is if the user would tap the same icon twice I would have the voice over spell the word out so the user can know exactly what the voice over is trying to say.

<p><b>Devices: Please list two devices (and some of their features) that are made specifically to support Accessibility.</b></p>

<p>
Samsung Galaxy S3 (My device) has features to support accessibility such as motion. There is a direct call feature that works to if the user wants to make a call all he has to do is select the contact and move the phone to his or her ear and it will automatically call that contact. This phone also has the feature to Speak passwords so when explore by touch is enabled (another feature that lets allows the device to read to you what you have touched) when a password field is selected the device will read the characters back to you that are being typed.
 
Apple IPhone 5 provides you with the VoiceOver, which the user can be read any item, displayed on the screen. Another feature used with VoiceOver is Wireless Braille, which gives the user a Wireless Braille display that uses Bluetooth to read VoiceOver output in braille. Another feature the iPhone 5 has for accessibility is the well known "Siri" that allows you to send messages, call contacts, and get directions to just name a few of the features of Siri but it pretty much does it all.
